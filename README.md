Door Sensor 935
===============

Arduino and Google App Engine python app for tracking a door's opening and closing. The Arduino setup uses 
a Reed switch and a magnet to detect door state, and a Wifly shield to access home access point. 

Came out of a problem I've had in my building where people leave the outside door open, which in my neighborhood, 
is an unsafe situation. The app emails our residents when the door is open for some period of time.
